# Sauce Hachée

The sauce Hachée is a classic sauce attributed to Escoffier, and it exists in two distinct versions: one for meat and one for fish. If you’re a fan of my Poulet en Vinaigre, you’ll love this tangy sauce. It’s based on a reduction of vinegar, shallots, onions, and mushrooms, which are then cooked with brown stock and some tomato sauce. Just before serving, a garnish of capers, gherkins, and finely chopped ham is sprinkled into the sauce.

## Mise en place 
Make sure that you have the demi glace or reduced stock ready before you start.

Peel and finely chopped all the vegetables as well as the capers, gherkins, ham and parsley. 

## Method
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat then add the onion, shallots and mushrooms then leave to cook gently on low heat for 5 minutes or until the onions are almost cooked.

When done, add the vinegar, bring to a light boil and reduce for 3 to 4 minutes.

add the demi glace (or reduced stock) and the tomato sauce then bring to a light boil. Reduce on a light boil for 5 minutes or more until the sauce is thick enough to easily coat the back of a spoon.

Just before serving add the garnish of capers, gherkins, ham and parsley and serve immediately.
